# Artificial Inteligence for Dino Game

Artificial Inteligence implementation for the Dino game

## Steps

This implementation was made in Python3.8.2. Before running the application, it's necessary to install some dependencies, for that run the following commands in your terminal:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you may run the application:

```
python3 mainGA.py
```

### Graphic
To fast train the model, theres also a version without the graphics, for that run:

```
python3 dinoAIrenderless.py
```

## Model
The model consists of a genetic algorithm to search the coordinates of the points used in the KNN classifier.

### Best Result
